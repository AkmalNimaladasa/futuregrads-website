      <h2>ðŸ“– Our Story</h2>
      <p><strong>Established in 2002</strong>, Future Grads International Academy began as a humble Montessori in Ratmalana with a powerful vision: to build strong educational foundations for the future leaders of our society.</p>

      <p>Founded by a passionate educator and mother, the school has grown over 23 years into a trusted home for early childhood learning â€” where students are not only taught, but truly cared for.</p>

      <p>Many of our children return years later as adults, still remembering the love, guidance, and values instilled in them during their earliest years here.</p>

      <p>At Future Grads, we believe that every child we teach is a future graduate â€” a future achiever, thinker, and contributor to the world.</p>
